# Planned Features

## Board-Level Remote Follows (Moderator-Managed)

Allow moderators to follow remote Fediverse actors on behalf of boards, pulling
their content into the board. Requires anti-loop and deduplication safeguards.

### Anti-Loop / Anti-Duplication Rules

1. **Never re-announce an Announce** — content arriving via `Announce` is stored
   and linked to the board but does NOT trigger an outbound `Announce`. Only
   content arriving via `Create` (directly authored) gets announced to followers.
2. **Cross-board announce dedup** — before a board announces an article, check if
   any local board has already announced the same `ap_id`. First board wins.
3. **Origin/addressing check** — only announce articles where the board's actor
   URI appears in the activity's `to` or `cc` (intentionally addressed, not relayed).
4. **Outbound announce rate limit** — cap Announces per board per time window
   (e.g., 30/hour) to prevent flood from a prolific followed actor.

### Implementation Notes

- Rules 1 + 2 are the minimum viable safeguards
- Rules 3 + 4 are defense-in-depth
- Need a new `board_follows` table (board_id, remote_actor_id, followed_by_id)
- Need UI in board moderator panel to manage follows
- Need to handle `Undo(Follow)` on unfollow
