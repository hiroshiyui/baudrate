# Baudrate — Project TODOs

---

## Feature Backlog

Identified via competitive analysis against Discourse, Lemmy, Flarum, NodeBB, and Misskey.

### High Priority — Core Forum Gaps

- [ ] **feat:** Polls — inline polls in articles (single-choice, multiple-choice, with optional expiry); federate as `Question` AP object
- [ ] **feat:** Rich link previews (oneboxing) — auto-expand YouTube, GitHub, Wikipedia, etc. links into embedded cards with metadata

### Lower Priority — Engagement & Platform

- [ ] **infra:** Admin analytics dashboard — DAU/MAU, posts/day, response times, community health metrics
- [ ] **infra:** S3 / CDN object storage — external media storage for horizontal scaling (currently local filesystem only)
