## [1.3.28] — 2026-03-16

### Added

- **Bot profile shows feed URL** — Bot user profiles now display the feed URL in the bio field automatically. The bio is set on bot creation and kept in sync whenever the feed URL is updated.

### Fixed

- **Bot avatar fetching** — The favicon fetcher now handles two common failure cases:
  - Sites that advertise only an SVG favicon (e.g. gamer.com.tw) — SVG links are now skipped; the `apple-touch-icon` PNG is used instead.
  - Sites that advertise only a `favicon.ico` but don't include it in `<link>` tags (e.g. ithome.com.tw) — each candidate URL is now tried end-to-end (download + avatar process); if ICO fails the avatar pipeline, the standard `/apple-touch-icon.png` path is probed as a fallback.
- **Article timestamps** — Bot and federated articles now show their original `published_at` date (from RSS `<pubDate>` / Atom `<published>`) instead of the time the bot fetched them. Regular user articles are unaffected.

## [1.3.27] — 2026-03-16

### Added

- **RSS/Atom Feed Bot Accounts** — Administrators can now create bot accounts that periodically fetch RSS/Atom feeds and post entries as articles. Bots are full ActivityPub actors — remote users and boards can follow them and receive federated articles. Bots cannot be logged into by humans and cannot receive DMs. A "Bot" badge is shown on profiles and post bylines.
- **Admin Bot Management UI** — New admin page at `/admin/bots` for creating, editing, toggling, and deleting bot accounts with feed URL, target boards, and fetch interval configuration.
- **Board Follows discoverability** — Added a "Follows" action link to the admin board management table for federated boards, so admins can reach board follows pages without explicitly being board moderators.

### Fixed

- **Bot login crash (critical)** — Logging in with a bot account username no longer causes a `CaseClauseError` (500 error). The attempt is now rejected with the same generic "Invalid username or password" message and recorded as a failed login attempt.
- **Feed item deduplication race** — `record_feed_item/3` now uses `on_conflict: :nothing` to safely handle concurrent duplicate GUID inserts without raising a constraint error.
- **User-Agent version** — The federation HTTP client now reads the version from `Application.spec/2` at runtime instead of hardcoding `0.1.0`, keeping the User-Agent accurate across releases.
- **Local handle search on board follows page** — Searching for a local user handle (e.g. `@botname`) on the board follows page now shows a helpful error directing the admin to configure bot board targets via Admin → Bots, instead of silently failing.

### Improved

- **Accessibility** — Bot badge spans now carry `role="img"` and `aria-label="Bot account"` for screen reader clarity. Profile page dropdown trigger has `aria-expanded`. Article thumbnail `alt` text now uses the article title instead of the generic "Article image".

## [1.3.26] — 2026-03-15

### Added

- **CI/CD Hardening** — Integrated `credo` linting, enforced `mix format` checks, and enabled `warnings-as-errors` in the GitHub CI pipeline to ensure long-term code quality.
- **Pending User Profiles** — Users awaiting administrative approval can now personalize their profile by uploading an avatar and updating their bio and display name.

### Changed

- **Auth Context Refactor** — Major architectural cleanup of the `Baudrate.Auth` module. Logic has been extracted into specialized sub-modules (`Invites`, `Sessions`, `SecondFactor`, `Moderation`, `Users`, `Profiles`, `Passwords`) while maintaining a clean facade.
- **Federation Context Refactor** — Architectural cleanup of the `Baudrate.Federation` module. Logic has been extracted into focused sub-modules (`Follows`, `Feed`, `Discovery`, `Collections`, `ObjectBuilder`, `ActorRenderer`) to improve maintainability and testability.
- **ArticleLive Refactor** — Simplified the main `ArticleLive` module by extracting pure helper logic into `ArticleHelpers` and moving comment tree rendering into `CommentComponents`.
- **Invite Quota Relaxation** — Removed the 7-day account age requirement for generating invite codes, allowing new users to invite others immediately after registration.

### Fixed

- **Compiler Warnings** — Cleaned up unused default values in test helpers (`insert_board/2`, `create_image/3`).
- **Code Hygiene** — Fixed multiple linting issues including large number formatting and expensive list length checks.

## [1.3.25] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Remote comment/DM image attachments** — image attachments on incoming
  federated comments and DMs are now displayed as `<img>` tags in the
  rendered body (HTTPS only). Previously, images sent as AP attachments
  on Note objects were silently stripped by the sanitizer.
- **Test coverage** — added 55 tests for `Content.Search`, `Content.ReadTracking`,
  and `InteractionHelpers` modules

### Fixed

- **Announce-to-boards missing images** — articles routed via Announce
  (boost) to boards now correctly extract and store image attachments
- **Actor resolver nil TTL** — `stale?()` no longer returns false when
  `actor_cache_ttl` config is nil (Elixir term ordering edge case),
  preventing stale actors from being served without refetch
- **AttachmentExtractor** — `Image` type attachments without a URL are
  now correctly rejected

## [1.3.24] — 2026-03-14

### Improved

- **Board search in article forwarding** — the forward-to-board search now
  matches against board slugs in addition to board names, making it easier
  to find boards by their URL identifier

## [1.3.23] — 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Actor discovery on Threads.net and similar instances** — expanded the
  signed fetch fallback to also trigger on 403 and 404 HTTP responses, not
  just 401. Threads.net returns 404 for unsigned actor profile requests,
  which previously prevented discovering and following accounts there

## [1.3.22] — 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Federation delivery crash on remote article like/boost** — liking or
  boosting a remote article (no local user) crashed `enqueue_for_article`
  with `BadMapError` when accessing `article.user.username`. Now skips user
  follower inbox resolution for remote articles

## [1.3.21] — 2026-03-12

### Added

- **User profile: boosted articles & comments** — user profile pages now show
  a two-column layout with recent articles & comments on the left and boosted
  articles & comments on the right, with content digests, image previews, and
  load-more pagination
- **Profile username link** — username on the profile settings page is now a
  clickable link to the public profile, with a copy-to-clipboard button for
  the full profile URL

### Fixed

- **Rate limiting gap** — the PWA Web Share Target endpoint (`POST /share`)
  now has rate limiting (10 req/min per IP)
- **Accessibility** — link preview images now have descriptive `alt` text,
  article elements have `aria-labelledby`/`aria-label` attributes, admin panel
  text opacity raised from 60% to 70% for WCAG AA contrast compliance
- **Defensive `Repo.get!` calls** — `stamp_local_ap_id` and `stamp_ap_id` now
  use `Repo.get` with graceful nil handling instead of raising on deleted
  records

### Tests

- Added 27 dedicated tests for `ArticleImageStorage` (image processing, edge
  cases, invalid inputs)
- Added 26 dedicated tests for `Content.Interactions` (visibility checks, role
  access, AP ID stamping)

## [1.3.20] — 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Remote article images** — articles imported via federation (inbox delivery,
  auto-routing to boards, and `/search` import) now fetch and store image
  attachments from the AP object's `attachment` array. Images go through the
  same security pipeline as local uploads (magic byte validation, WebP
  re-encoding, EXIF strip, max 1024px)

## [1.3.19] — 2026-03-10

### Changed

- **Draft save indicator** — replaced "Draft saved" text with a loading dots
  animation during debounce and a cloud-arrow-up Heroicon when saved;
  indicator is now inline after the submit button in all forms

## [1.3.18] — 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- **Draft indicator layout shift** — moved "Draft saved" indicator outside
  the inline controls row in article new, edit, and comment forms so it no
  longer pushes the visibility selector and submit button when appearing
- **Inline form controls vertical alignment** — stripped DaisyUI fieldset
  and label padding in all inline form control rows (article new/edit,
  comment, reply, feed quick-post) for proper vertical centering
- **Comment and reply form controls left-aligned** — visibility selector
  and Post/Reply button are now left-aligned with flex-wrap for mobile
  responsiveness, consistent with article and feed forms
- **Search operators card readability** — bumped title and table text size
  for better readability
- **Ansible version comparison** — stripped `v` prefix before semver
  comparison to prevent false "deploying older version" warnings

## [1.3.15] — 2026-03-10

### Changed

- **Article form controls consolidated** — visibility selector, "Allow
  forwarding" checkbox, and Create/Save button now share a single inline
  row on article create and edit pages; visibility label removed (kept as
  `aria-label` for accessibility)
- **Markdown toolbar repositioned** — formatting toolbar now appears below
  the textarea instead of above it
- **Feed quick-post controls left-aligned** — visibility selector and Post
  button in the feed composer are now left-aligned with flex-wrap for
  mobile responsiveness

## [1.3.14] — 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- **Comment visibility selector layout** — moved the visibility selector
  before the Post/Reply button in comment and reply forms; fixed vertical
  misalignment caused by DaisyUI fieldset margin

## [1.3.13] — 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- **False "edited" indicator on Mastodon** — ActivityPub article objects no
  longer unconditionally include the `"updated"` field; it is now only emitted
  when the article was genuinely edited (>5s after creation), preventing
  Mastodon from showing an "edited" badge on unedited articles

### Reverted

- **Sitemap generation** — reverted v1.3.13–v1.3.15 sitemap feature due to
  OTP release read-only filesystem constraints; will revisit with a different
  approach

## [1.3.12] — 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Visibility selector** — article create/edit forms, comment forms, and feed
  quick post now include a visibility selector (Public, Unlisted, Followers-only,
  Direct) with full i18n support (en, zh_TW, ja_JP)
- **Remote object resolution via search** — paste a remote Fediverse post URL
  into search to preview it without storing; click "Import & interact" to
  materialize locally for liking, boosting, or forwarding (two-phase
  `ObjectResolver.fetch/1` + `resolve/1`, loop-safe)
- **Feed item and comment forwarding to boards** — users can forward feed items
  and comments to boards they have posting access to, with federation publishing
- **Forwarding UI** — forward buttons on feed items and comments with board
  selector modal
- **Nginx bot/scanner blocking rules** — example configuration for blocking
  common vulnerability scanners and malicious bots

### Fixed

- **Article title length validation** — all article changesets now enforce
  max 255 characters; `TitleDeriver` truncates remote AP object names to
  prevent oversized titles from malicious servers
- **Deterministic query ordering** — added `id` tiebreakers to all `order_by`
  queries across auth, content, federation, messaging, and moderation contexts
  to prevent nondeterministic results when timestamps collide
- **Comment creation mixed map keys** — normalized all keys to strings before
  merging `body_html` to prevent `Ecto.CastError` under concurrent execution
- **Visibility selector alignment** — fixed DaisyUI fieldset margin causing
  misalignment with Post button in feed quick post
- **Fuzzy gettext auto-matches** — cleared all incorrect fuzzy translations
  (e.g., "Public" → "Public Key") across en, zh_TW, ja_JP locales
- **Remote article forwardable flag** — added `:forwardable` to remote article
  changeset so visibility-based forwardability is persisted

### Changed

- **TitleDeriver extracted** — title derivation logic moved to shared
  `Content.TitleDeriver` module for reuse across inbox handler and
  ObjectResolver

## [1.3.11] — 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **DM input not clearing after send** — message compose input now clears
  after sending by using a dynamic form ID that forces DOM recreation
- **Send button icon disappearing** — removed `phx-disable-with` that was
  stripping the paper airplane icon and not restoring it after re-enable

## [1.3.10] — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **YouTube video embeds** — link previews for YouTube URLs now render an
  embedded video player (via privacy-enhanced `youtube-nocookie.com`) instead
  of a static Open Graph card; supports watch, youtu.be, embed, and shorts URLs
- **Boosted content in personal feed** — articles boosted (Announced) by
  followed remote accounts now appear in the user's personal feed with
  boost attribution; supports both bare-URI and embedded-object Announce formats
  (Mastodon and Lemmy interop)
- **Board routing for boosts** — boosted Article/Page content is routed to
  boards following the booster, with deduplication by `ap_id` to prevent
  duplicates when multiple actors boost the same content; Notes remain feed-only
- **Remote image attachments** — image attachments from remote ActivityPub
  objects are displayed in the feed timeline (up to 4 images per item)

### Fixed

- **Flaky federation tests** — `ValidatorTest` no longer relies on
  `Application.get_env` which could return `nil` during concurrent test runs;
  `ActorResolverTest` uses unique `ap_id` values to prevent race conditions

### Security

- **CSP frame-src** — added `frame-src https://www.youtube-nocookie.com` to
  Content Security Policy; only YouTube embeds are allowed, no other iframes

## [1.3.9] — 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **Remote article "View original" links** — links now point to the
  human-readable URL (e.g. `https://instance/@user/123`) instead of the
  canonical AP ID (e.g. `https://instance/ap/users/.../statuses/...`);
  a new `url` field on articles stores the browsable permalink from
  incoming ActivityPub objects

### Added

- **"View original" link on article page** — remote articles now show a
  "View original" link on the full article detail page

## [1.3.8] — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **@mention autocomplete** — typing `@` in article, comment, and feed text
  areas shows a dropdown of matching users; supports keyboard navigation
  (Arrow keys, Enter/Tab to accept, Escape to dismiss)
- **Federated mention suggestions** — the @mention dropdown includes remote
  actors who participated in the current discussion thread (article author
  and commenters), displayed as `@username@domain`

## [1.3.7] — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Article images in ActivityPub payload** — federated articles now include
  uploaded images as Document attachments, visible on remote instances
- **Article images in feed and board views** — article image thumbnails are
  displayed in the feed timeline and board article listings
- **Add Images icon button** — replaced the file input widget with a compact
  icon button; "Add Images" and "Add Poll" now share a single toolbar row

### Fixed

- **Multi-image upload stalling** — fixed parallel uploads silently failing by
  consuming each upload entry individually as it completes
- **Oversized file upload errors not shown** — per-entry upload errors (e.g.
  file too large) are now displayed to the user

## [1.3.6] — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Full-featured feed post composer** — the feed quick-post form now includes
  a markdown formatting toolbar, image uploads (up to 4 images), and optional
  polls, matching the article creation page
- **Collapsible markdown toolbar** — all markdown toolbars now have a pencil
  icon toggle to collapse/expand formatting buttons; collapsed by default,
  state persisted in localStorage

## [1.3.5] — 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **Wrong repository URL in NodeInfo** — `software.repository` in `/nodeinfo/2.1`
  now points to the correct GitHub repository

## [1.3.4] — 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **Instance actor not discoverable via WebFinger** — remote instances querying
  `acct:site@host` now correctly resolve to the site actor (`/ap/site`) instead
  of returning 404, enabling proper instance-level federation discovery

## [1.3.3] — 2026-03-08

### Added

- **"Remove from board" action** on multi-board articles — when an article exists
  in multiple boards, the dropdown shows per-board removal buttons that detach
  the article from individual boards without affecting forwarded copies

### Fixed

- **Forwarded article disappears from all boards on delete** — deleting a
  multi-board article now only removes the board association, not the article
  itself; forwarded copies in other boards remain visible
- **Soft-deleted articles accessible via direct URL** — `get_article_by_slug!`
  now filters out articles with `deleted_at` set, returning 404 instead of
  showing deleted content

## [1.3.2] — 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **Startup crash in v1.3.1** — `shutdown_timeout` must be nested under
  `thousand_island_options` in Bandit config, not at the top level

## [1.3.1] — 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Near-zero downtime deploys** — nginx `proxy_next_upstream` retries requests
  during restarts (up to 30s, 3 attempts) with custom 502 maintenance page as
  fallback; Bandit `shutdown_timeout` drains in-flight requests for 30s on
  SIGTERM; systemd `TimeoutStopSec=35` for graceful shutdown margin

### Changed

- Database migrations now run **before** symlink swap and service restart during
  Ansible deploys, reducing the restart window to just the symlink swap + restart

### Documentation

- Added "Near-Zero Downtime Deploys" section to SysOp guide
- Added CHANGELOG.md update step to release engineering checklist in CLAUDE.md

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Article and comment boosts** — fully federated via ActivityPub `Announce` /
  `Undo(Announce)` activities, with self-boost prevention and soft-delete guards
- **Like and boost buttons** on article pages, board listings, and personal feed
  for both local content and remote feed items
- **Feed item interactions** — like and boost remote feed items, sending AP
  `Like` / `Announce` activities to the remote actor's inbox
- **Boost notification types** — `article_boosted` and `comment_boosted` with
  per-user notification preferences
- New database tables: `article_boosts`, `comment_boosts`, `feed_item_likes`,
  `feed_item_boosts`

### Changed

- **Comment likes now federated** — upgraded from local-only to sending AP
  `Like` / `Undo(Like)` activities with AP ID stamping (previously comment likes
  had no federation support)
- **Shared interaction helpers** — extracted `Content.Interactions` module
  (visibility checks, AP ID stamping, constraint detection) and
  `InteractionHelpers` module (generic LiveView toggle handlers), reducing ~336
  lines of duplication across likes, boosts, and three LiveViews

### Fixed

- **Unsafe integer parsing in feed toggle handlers** — replaced
  `String.to_integer` with `parse_id/1` to prevent crashes from malicious input
- **IDOR on feed item interactions** — added `feed_item_accessible?/2` check to
  verify user follows the remote actor before allowing like/boost
- **Board visibility bypass on like/boost** — added `article_visible_to_user?/2`
  to prevent interaction with articles in boards the user lacks permission to view
- **Remote Like/Announce on private content** — inbox handler now rejects
  incoming AP activities targeting articles in non-public or non-AP-enabled boards
- **Missing AP ID format validation** — remote boost schemas now validate that
  `ap_id` is an HTTP(S) URL
- **Missing `comment_liked` notification preference** in profile settings UI

### Security

- Board visibility enforcement on all like/boost toggle operations
- Feed item access validation requiring active follow relationship
- AP ID URL format validation on remote boost changesets
- Reject federation activities targeting non-federated content
